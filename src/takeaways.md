# Notes on Execution

- When working in parallel, it sometimes fucks up larger tasks, like authentication, since they are entire systems
- It didn't connect stuff to the database.
- It made buttons on screens that weren't requested

## Solution

- Make supabase with auth
- More concretely define screens
